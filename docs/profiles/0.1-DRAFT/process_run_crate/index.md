# Process Run Crate

* Version: 0.1-DRAFT
* Permalink: <https://w3id.org/ro/wfrun/process/0.1-DRAFT> `TODO: update`
* Authors: [Workflow Run RO-Crate members](/workflow-run-crate/#community)

This profile uses terminology from the [RO-Crate 1.1 specification](https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1).


## Overview

This profile is used to describe the execution of an _implicit_ workflow, indicating that one or more computational tools have been executed, typically generating some result files that are represented as [data entities](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/data-entities.html) in the RO-Crate.

By "implicit workflow" we mean that the composition of these tools may have been done by hand (a user executes one tool following another) or by some script that has not yet been included as part of the crate (for instance because it is an embedded part of a larger application).

This profile requires the indication of [Software used to create files](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/provenance.html#software-used-to-create-files), namely a [SoftwareApplication](http://schema.org/SoftwareApplication) (the tool) and a [CreateAction](http://schema.org/CreateAction) (the execution of said tool).

Note that the command line shown in the action's `description` is not directly re-executable, as file paths are not required to match the RO-Crate locations. For a more structural and reproducible description of tool executions, see [Workflow Run Crate](workflow_run_crate).

</table>

Entities referenced by an action's [object](http://schema.org/object) or [result](http://schema.org/result) SHOULD be of type `File` (an RO-Crate alias for [MediaObject](http://schema.org/MediaObject)) or [Dataset](http://schema.org/Dataset) (directory), but MAY be a [CreativeWork](http://schema.org/CreativeWork) for other types of data (e.g. an online database); they MAY be of type [PropertyValue](http://schema.org/PropertyValue) to capture numbers/strings that are not stored as files.

Data entities involved in an application's input and output SHOULD have an `@id` that reflects the original file or directory name as processed by the application, but MAY be renamed to avoid clashes with other entities in the crate. In this case, they SHOULD refer to the original name via [alternateName](http://schema.org/alternateName). This is particularly important to support reproducibility in cases where an application expects to find input in specific locations and with specific names (see the MIRAX example in [Representing multi-file objects](#representing-multi-file-objects)).


## Multiple processes

A process crate can be used to indicate one single execution as a single `CreateAction`, or a series of processes that generate different data entities. These actions MAY form an *implicit workflow* by following the links between entities that appear as `result` in an action and as `object` in the following one, but a process crate is not required to ensure such consistency (e.g. there may be an intermediate action that has not been recorded).

## Referencing configuration files

Some applications support the modification of their behavior via configuration files. Typically, these are not part of the input interface, but are searched for by the application among a set of possible predefined file system paths. In the case of applications that support a configuration file, the specific configuration file used during a run SHOULD be added to the `object` attribute of the corresponding `CreateAction`, especially if its settings are different from the default ones.

```json
    {
        "@id": "#SepiaConversion_1",
        "@type": "CreateAction",
        "name": "Convert dog image to sepia",
        "description": "convert -sepia-tone 80% test_data/sample/pics/2017-06-11\\ 12.56.14.jpg test_data/sample/pics/sepia_fence.jpg",
        "endTime": "2018-09-19T17:01:07+10:00",
        "instrument": {"@id": "https://www.imagemagick.org/"},
        "object": [
            {"@id": "pics/2017-06-11%2012.56.14.jpg"},
            {"@id": "SepiaConversion_1/colors.xml"}
        ]
        "result": {"@id": "pics/sepia_fence.jpg"},
        "agent": {"@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9842-9718"}
    },
    {
        "@id": "SepiaConversion_1/colors.xml",
        "@type": "File",
        "description": "Imagemagick color names configuration",
        "encodingFormat": "text/xml",
        "name": "colors"
    }
```


## Representing multi-file objects

In some formats, the data belonging to a digital entity is stored in more than one file. For instance, the [Mirax2-Fluorescence-2](https://openslide.cs.cmu.edu/download/openslide-testdata/Mirax/Mirax2-Fluorescence-2.zip) image is stored as the following set of files:

```
Mirax2-Fluorescence-2.mrxs
Mirax2-Fluorescence-2/Index.dat
Mirax2-Fluorescence-2/Slidedat.ini
Mirax2-Fluorescence-2/Data0000.dat
Mirax2-Fluorescence-2/Data0001.dat
...
Mirax2-Fluorescence-2/Data0023.dat
```

An application that reads [this format](https://openslide.org/formats/mirax/) needs to be pointed to the `.mrxs` file, and expects to find a directory containing the other files in the same location as the `.mrxs` file, with the same name minus the extension. Thus, even though an application that processes MIRAX files would probably take only the `.mrxs` file as argument, the other ones must be present in the expected location and with the expected names (in CWL, this kind of relationship is expressed via `secondaryFiles`). In this case, the object SHOULD be represented by a [contextual entity](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/contextual-entities.html) of type [Collection](http://schema.org/Collection) listing all files under `hasPart`, with a `mainEntity` referencing the main file. The collection SHOULD be referenced from the root data entity via `mentions`.

```json
{
    "@id": "./",
    "@type": "Dataset",
    "hasPart": [
        {"@id": "Mirax2-Fluorescence-2.mrxs"},
        {"@id": "Mirax2-Fluorescence-2/"},
        {"@id": "Mirax2-Fluorescence-2.png"}
    ],
    "mentions": [
        {"@id": "https://openslide.cs.cmu.edu/download/openslide-testdata/Mirax/Mirax2-Fluorescence-2.zip"},
		{"@id": "#conversion_1"}
    ]
},
{
    "@id": "https://openslide.org/",
    "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
    "url": "https://openslide.org/",
    "name": "OpenSlide",
    "version": "3.4.1"
},
{
    "@id": "#conversion_1",
    "@type": "CreateAction",
    "name": "Convert image to PNG",
    "endTime": "2018-09-19T17:01:07+10:00",
    "instrument": {"@id": "https://openslide.org/"},
    "object": {"@id": "https://openslide.cs.cmu.edu/download/openslide-testdata/Mirax/Mirax2-Fluorescence-2.zip"},
    "result": {"@id": "Mirax2-Fluorescence-2.png"}
},
{
    "@id": "https://openslide.cs.cmu.edu/download/openslide-testdata/Mirax/Mirax2-Fluorescence-2.zip",
    "@type": "Collection",
    "mainEntity": {"@id": "Mirax2-Fluorescence-2.mrxs"},
    "hasPart": [
        {"@id": "Mirax2-Fluorescence-2.mrxs"},
        {"@id": "Mirax2-Fluorescence-2/"}
    ]
},
{
    "@id": "Mirax2-Fluorescence-2.mrxs",
    "@type": "File"
},
{
    "@id": "Mirax2-Fluorescence-2/",
    "@type": "Dataset"
},
{
    "@id": "Mirax2-Fluorescence-2.png",
    "@type": "File"
}
```

If the collection does not have a web presence, its `@id` can be an arbitrary internal one, possibly randomly generated (as for any other contextual entity):

```json
{
    "@id": "#af0253d688f3409a2c6d24bf6b35df7c4e271292",
    "@type": "Collection",
    "mainEntity": {"@id": "Mirax2-Fluorescence-2.mrxs"},
    "hasPart": [
        {"@id": "Mirax2-Fluorescence-2.mrxs"},
        {"@id": "Mirax2-Fluorescence-2/"}
    ]
}
```

The use case shown here is an example of a situation where it's important to refer to the original names in case any renamings took place, as described in [Requirements](#requirements):

```json
{
    "@id": "#af0253d688f3409a2c6d24bf6b35df7c4e271292",
    "@type": "Collection",
    "mainEntity": {"@id": "f62aa607a75508ac5fc6a22e9c0e39ef58a2c852"},
    "hasPart": [
        {"@id": "f62aa607a75508ac5fc6a22e9c0e39ef58a2c852"},
        {"@id": "c7398fbf741b851e80ae731d60cbee9258ff81f3/"}
    ]
},
{
    "@id": "f62aa607a75508ac5fc6a22e9c0e39ef58a2c852",
    "@type": "File",
    "alternateName": "Mirax2-Fluorescence-2.mrxs"
},
{
    "@id": "c7398fbf741b851e80ae731d60cbee9258ff81f3/",
    "@type": "Dataset",
    "alternateName": "Mirax2-Fluorescence-2/",
    "hasPart": [
        {"@id": "c7398fbf741b851e80ae731d60cbee9258ff81f3/46c443af080a36000c9298b49b675eb240eeb41c"},
        ...
    ]
},
{
    "@id": "c7398fbf741b851e80ae731d60cbee9258ff81f3/46c443af080a36000c9298b49b675eb240eeb41c",
    "@type": "File",
    "alternateName": "Mirax2-Fluorescence-2/Index.dat"
},
...
```
