# Run of digital pathology tissue/tumor prediction workflow

This dataset is an [RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/) representation of an execution of the tissue/tumor prediction workflow for digital pathology from [crs4/deephealth-pipelines](https://github.com/crs4/deephealth-pipelines/tree/c54840df08742e3aa454394e0e74d15fbd640f07). It follows the [Provenance Run Crate](https://w3id.org/ro/wfrun/provenance/0.1) profile.

The workflow has been run with [cwltool](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/tree/3.1.20230213100550), using the `--provenance` option to generate a [CWLProv](https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giz095) RO bundle, and then converted to an RO-Crate using [runcrate](https://github.com/ResearchObject/runcrate/tree/755fb7f0a8ba6fc238a2cb7a3218175644eb78b5). The input dataset is [Mirax2-Fluorescence-2](https://openslide.cs.cmu.edu/download/openslide-testdata/Mirax/Mirax2-Fluorescence-2.zip) by Yves Sucaet, from the [MIRAX test data](https://openslide.cs.cmu.edu/download/openslide-testdata/Mirax/).

The workflow stored in the crate (`packed.cwl`) is a [packed](https://www.commonwl.org/v1.2/Workflow.html#Packed_documents) representation of the [workflow from crs4/deephealth-pipelines](https://github.com/crs4/deephealth-pipelines/tree/c54840df08742e3aa454394e0e74d15fbd640f07/cwl), released under the following license:
