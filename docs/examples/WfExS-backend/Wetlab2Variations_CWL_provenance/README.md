# Notes about this generated RO-Crate

RO-Crate from staged WfExS working directory a37fee9e-4288-4a9e-b493-993a867207d0 (meer oxometalate)

This RO-Crate has been generated by WfExS-backend 0.9.3-192-g93901ff (93901ff9f5e88903b917d62cd0302454ae52364c, branch main) ,
whose sources are available at https://github.com/inab/WfExS-backend.

## Software containers and metadata

Metadata files which are produced and consumed by WfExS-backend in
order to properly detect when a local cached copy of a software container
is stale are also included in this RO-Crate. These files are in JSON format.

In case this RO-Crate also contains a copy of the software containers,
their format will depend on whether they are going to be consumed by
Singularity / Apptainer, or they are going to be consumed by Docker or Podman.

Singularity / Apptainer images usually have the singularity image format.

Both Docker and Podman images are compressed tar archives obtained through
either `docker save` or `podman save` commands. These archives have all
the layers needed to restore the container image in a local registry
through either `docker load` or `podman load`.

## Posibly used URI schemes

As WfExS-backend is able to manage several exotic CURIEs and schemes,
you can find here an almost complete list of the possible ones:

* `pride.project`: 'pride' datasets metadata is fetched using the APIs described at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/v2/swagger-ui.html#/projects . Contents are downloaded delegating their associated URIs to other fetchers

* `drs`: GA4GH DRS datasets metadata is fetched using the APIs described at https://ga4gh.github.io/data-repository-service-schemas/. Contents are downloaded delegating their associated URIs to other fetchers

* `wfexs.trs.files`: WfExS internal pseudo-scheme used to materialize files from pure TRS servers

* `trs`: GA4GH TRS metadata is fetched using the APIs described at https://ga4gh.github.io/tool-registry-service-schemas/. Contents are downloaded delegating their associated URIs to other fetchers

* `s3`: Amazon S3 resource path scheme, whose downloads are delegated on libraries implementing its support

* `gs`: Google Cloud Storage resource path scheme, whose downloads are delegated on Google Cloud Storage libraries

* `fasp`: This pseudo-scheme, which mimics ssh scheme, represents datasets behind IBM Aspera servers (quite common in life sciences infrastructures), which follow FASP protocol. Materialization of these datasets are delegated to ascp command line

* `doi`: DOIs resolve to web sites. A subset of the different DOI providers also point to datasets, like the ones from Zenodo, B2SHARE or osf.io. Fetcher implementing DOI support either delegates on other specialized fetchers or delegates the download of the resolved URL.

* `zenodo`: CURIEs following this scheme can be translated to a downloadable dataset, using APIs described at https://developers.zenodo.org/

* `b2share`: CURIEs following this scheme can be translated to a downloadable dataset, using APIs described at https://eudat.eu/services/userdoc/b2share-http-rest-api#get-specific-record

* `osf.io`: CURIEs following this scheme can be translated to a downloadable dataset, using APIs described at https://developer.osf.io/

* `git`: 'git' scheme and pseudo-schemes 'git+file', 'git+https', 'git+ssh' (based on https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/vcs-support/) and 'github' are managed by using git command line, applying minimal transformations in the URI.

* `git+file`: 'git' scheme and pseudo-schemes 'git+file', 'git+https', 'git+ssh' (based on https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/vcs-support/) and 'github' are managed by using git command line, applying minimal transformations in the URI.

* `git+https`: 'git' scheme and pseudo-schemes 'git+file', 'git+https', 'git+ssh' (based on https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/vcs-support/) and 'github' are managed by using git command line, applying minimal transformations in the URI.

* `git+http`: 'git' scheme and pseudo-schemes 'git+file', 'git+https', 'git+ssh' (based on https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/vcs-support/) and 'github' are managed by using git command line, applying minimal transformations in the URI.

* `git+ssh`: 'git' scheme and pseudo-schemes 'git+file', 'git+https', 'git+ssh' (based on https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/vcs-support/) and 'github' are managed by using git command line, applying minimal transformations in the URI.

* `github`: 'git' scheme and pseudo-schemes 'git+file', 'git+https', 'git+ssh' (based on https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/vcs-support/) and 'github' are managed by using git command line, applying minimal transformations in the URI.

* `swh`: Permanent identifiers of files, directories and repos at SoftwareHeritage. These URIs follow what it is described at https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/swh-model/persistent-identifiers.html

* `http`: HTTP download URLs

* `https`: HTTPS download URLs

* `ftp`: File Transfer Protocol (see https://www.iana.org/assignments/ftp-commands-extensions/ftp-commands-extensions.xhtml)

* `sftp`: 'sftp' scheme represents contents behind an SSH server

* `ssh`: 'ssh' scheme represents contents behind an SSH server

* `file`: 'file' scheme is used to represent local files and directories. It should be only used either for development or for very isolated environments where paths are stable.

* `data`: 'data' scheme is used to embed very small payloads, as it is described at https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2397
