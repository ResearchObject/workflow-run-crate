# revsortlcase

Example of workflow that uses other workflows to implement steps (subworkflows, or nested workflows). The first step runs a simplified implementation of the revsort workflow used in the [CWLProv RO Example](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwlprov/tree/ce3f469745f4c8a2c029f872d522a4c57fba947b/examples/revsort-run-1); the second step runs a tool that changes text to lowercase.
